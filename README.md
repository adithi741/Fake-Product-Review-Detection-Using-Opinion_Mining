Introduction
In the digital era, online reviews play a crucial role in shaping product reputations and driving sales. However, fake reviews are intentionally written to mislead consumers. This project implements a Fake Review Detection System that:

Identifies fake reviews based on patterns and IP addresses.
Uses machine learning techniques for analysis and detection.
Removes fake reviews to ensure genuine feedback is available to users.
✨ Features
Fake Review Detection: Identifies deceptive reviews using sentiment analysis and opinion mining.
Review Management: Automatically flags and removes fake reviews.
Insights: Provides detailed analysis to manufacturers and admins for decision-making.
User Safety: Protects customers from misleading information and financial losses.
